      <description>Tiffany Phan tp24326IntroductionThe datasets I chose focus on the health of Texas counties from 2018 to 2022. The datasets are Length of Life, Quality of Life, and Other Health Behaviors. These datasets were collected from CountyHealthRankings, a website that ranks the health of counties across the country each year. It does this by weighing various health indicators, which include the datasets I chose. Itâ€™s important to note that CountyHealthRankings employs an extensive list of health indicators but I am only interested in a small subset.</description>
